    *It started like any good mystery: quietly.*
    Sales soared. Headlines celebrated. Bonuses flowed.

    But beneath the surface, something didn't add up. Margins‚Äîthose thin lifelines of profit‚Äîwere vanishing. Not dipped. Not declined. *Gone.*

    Welcome to Superstore's strangest quarter yet.
    You're the analyst called in to solve the case.

    You'll follow clues across regions, customers, and categories. You'll interrogate discounts and revisit past orders. You'll uncover blind spots no one dared to examine.

    Each screen in this dashboard is a *chapter*. Each chart: a clue.
    This isn't just data‚Äîit's a crime scene.
